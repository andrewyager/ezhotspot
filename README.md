Simple Hotspot for Juniper WLC environment with guest access

This project is inspried by [this forum post](http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Wireless-LAN/Micro-External-Captive-Portal-DIY/td-p/151848)
and the desire to build a more full featrued web app to handle anonymous guest access for multiple portals.

This is a django based app (1.6 or greater) designed to run in virtaulenv. Currently it is still very much in development.
